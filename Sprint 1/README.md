### Members Present:
Jason Beesla, Cameron Sutcliffe, Leia Ainscough, Ivan Amigo and Bernard Aihevba

### Members Not Present:


### Apologies:
Andrej Kocak - Working

### Summary of Conversation:
Yesterday we constructed the user stories, created the product backlog, sprint backlog and attempted to setup the repository and link it to Azure for the project. We also assigned roles to each other - Leia being the product owner, Jason being the scrum master, and Cameron, Andrej, Ivan and Bernard being the developers. We then prioritised the stories using estimation techniques as a group. We did face an issue however regarding getting the Azure to work, which is a big problem as we can't progress very far in development without it working. Cameron is working on sorting it by the end of today and is consulting with Mike on fixing it. We are working on in the next 24 hours getting a skeleton version of the website working on a desktop, so that we can build all of the other features on top of this.

Since we last met, we made a skeleton version of the home page and an initial setup page for the backend, to allow us to start development. In the next 24 hours we are going to set up the home page with links to the other pages. We are also going to populate the pages with information about each goal, and events that include contact details. We did have further issues with getting Azure fully working, however that has been resolved now.

## Day [3] - Scrum Meeting summary
The Scrum Master for this meeting was Jason Beesla

### Members Present:
Jason Beesla, Cameron Sutcliffe, Leia Ainscough, Ivan Amigo and Bernard Aihevba

### Members Not Present:


### Apologies:
Andrej Kocak – Working

### Summary of Conversation:
Since we last met we did populate all of the pages with the basic information on each goal. We also managed to get a basic version of the homepage working, which displays all of the different pages that can be accessed.
We are going to work on the design of the pages, and adding tables which contain the events and the details of the events to the pages. In the next 24 hours we will also add a feature which lets an admin add events to the page.
We did however feature issues with the Azure again. One of the lines in the index.php file was missing a comma and this causes all of the pages to break down, meaning that a considerable amount of time was spent troubleshooting and trying to solve this issue. This has however been rectified now and the website is back up and running.
