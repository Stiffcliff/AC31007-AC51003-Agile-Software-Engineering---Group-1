## Day [1] - Scrum Meeting summary
The Scrum Master for this meeting was Jason Beesla

### Members Present:
Jason Beesla, Cameron Sutcliffe, Leia Ainscough, Ivan Amigo and Bernard Aihevba

### Members Not Present:


### Apologies:
Andrej Kocak - Working

### Summary of Conversation:
Yesterday we constructed the user stories, created the product backlog, sprint backlog and attempted to setup the repository and link it to Azure for the project. We also assigned roles to each other - Leia being the product owner, Jason being the scrum master, and Cameron, Andrej, Ivan and Bernard being the developers. We then prioritised the stories using estimation techniques as a group. We did face an issue however regarding getting the Azure to work, which is a big problem as we can't progress very far in development without it working. Cameron is working on sorting it by the end of today and is consulting with Mike on fixing it. We are working on in the next 24 hours getting a skeleton version of the website working on a desktop, so that we can build all of the other features on top of this.
