### Members Not Present:


### Apologies:

Things we did:
- Andrej and Cameron carried on working on back end functionality to edit the record
- Leia worked on the sprint 2 backlog, and looked up the coordinates for all the locations and then created the project for sprint 2
- Ivan looked into fully implementing bootstrap further within our website
- Bernard looked into the map APIs and options on how he can implement them
- Jason looked into APIs that we could use to send the email on the contact form

Things we need to do over next 24 hours:
- Andrej and Cameron are going to finish developing the back end functionality on editing the records
- Leia and Bernard are going to collaborate on getting the maps to work
- Ivan is going to carry on with the styling of the page
- Jason is going to get a basic version of the contact us page completed

Issues/Blockers:
- An issue we have faced is some of the events don't have a particular location, so further digging is required.
- Another issue we have faced is that we cannot test our changes live, since we are using separate branches now and the web app only pulls changes from the main branch.

Issues/Blockers:
- An issue we faced was that since the repo was public the Sendgrid API did not like this and suspended the account we used for the contact us page, we then made the repository private which then caused other things to break.
- The nav bar has become half size, and we are unsure as to what has caused this issue.
