### Apologies:


### Summary of Conversation:
Things we did:
Andrej and Cameron carried on working on back end functionality to edit the record
Leia worked on the sprint 2 backlog, and looked up the coordinates for all the locations and then created the project for sprint 2
Ivan looked into fully implementing bootstrap further within our website
Bernard looked into the map APIs and options on how he can implement them
Jason looked into APIs that we could use to send the email on the contact form

Things we need to do over next 24 hours:
Andrej and Cameron are going to finish developing the back end functionality on editing the records
Leia and Bernard are going to collaborate on getting the maps to work
Ivan is going to carry on with the styling of the page
Jason is going to get a basic version of the contact us page completed

Issues/Blockers:
An issue we have faced is some of the events don't have a particular location, so further digging is required.
Another issue we have faced is that we cannot test our changes live, since we are using separate branches now and the web app only pulls changes from the main branch.
